## Use Openblocks in 3 steps
* Connect to any datasource or api.
* Build UI with 50+ components.
* Share with collegues and customers.

## Why Openblocks
It is cumbersome to create a single app, you have to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, understand how all of that code works together.

Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with, but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.

Retool-like solutions are great for their simplicity and flexibility, but they can also be limited in different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.

Openblocks wants to take it forward. More specifically, Openblocks is
* An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing apps.
* A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications.
* A domain specific language that UI-configurable block is the first class citizen.

## Features
* Visual UI builder with 50+ built-in components.
* Native connection to PostgresSQL, MongoDB, Mysql, Redis, Elasticsearch, RestAPI, SMTP etc.
* Write Javascript everywhere, use Javascript to transform data, control components etc.
* Module and Query library, create reusable components/queries using the UI builder.
* Create and share custom components using react and openblocks-sdk(instead of iFrame). (pre-alpha).
* Embed openblocks pages as a react component(instead of iFrame).
* RBAC based access management
* Theme support
* auto-save and rollback to history
* Audit logs

## Comparisons
### Openblocks vs Retool 
* Openblocks is open-source. You don't have to worry about vendor lockin or being stuck with an outdated version of the software.
* In Openblocks, developers can create and use their own components instead of depending on offical updates.
* Openblocks supports left menu navigation (like most sites do). Retool has header navigation only.

### Openblocks vs Appsmith, Tooljet
* Openblocks has more components and richer configuration than Appsmith and Tooljet.
* In Openblocks, you can choose between auto-height or fixed-height mode for your components, while Appsmith supports fixed-height mode only.
* In Openblocks, you can reuse common structures when building apps using module and query library features.
